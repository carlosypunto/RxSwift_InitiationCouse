# RxSwift_InitiationCouse

> This project is a test and it is in construcction

These examples assume that:

* you know cocoapods and how to use it
* you know what functions like map, filter and reduce are.

likely 00_InitialConcepts.playground introduces map, filter and reduce


### Observables & Disposables

RxSwift we have two main types Observables (Sequences) y Disposables (Observers)
- Observables are objects that can change in value over time
- Disposables are responsible to do something when an Observable triggers an event
